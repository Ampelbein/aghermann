Building requirements for Aghermann are:

- gcc-4.5 (we are using -std=c++0x), optionally with openmp support.

- the following packges in versions current as per around mid-2011;
  though earlier versions might work:

     libgtk-3.0
     cairo
     fftw3
     gsl
     samplerate
     boost

Then do ./configure && make install.
