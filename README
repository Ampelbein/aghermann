Project Aghermann
-----------------

This is project Aghermann, a program by Andrei Zavada
(johnhommer@gmail.com) designed to run Process S simulations on
Slow-Wave Activity profiles from (human) EEG recordings as outlined in
Achermann et al (1993).  In this capacity, Aghermann produces a set of
sleep homeostat parameters which can be used to describe and
differentiate individual sleepers, such as short vs long sleepers,
early vs late, etc.

Also provided are general-purpose facilities for displaying EEG and
accompanying recordings, such as EOG and EMG, saved in EDF (European
Data Format) files.  These recordings can then be conveniently scored;
scores can be imported/exported in plain ASCII.  No scoring asistance
is provided (nor was it planned): sleep stage identification is thus
manual only.

Aghermann keeps the recordings in an organized fashion in a tree,
following an experimental design commonly used in sleep research,
i.e., groups of subjects sleeping several (timed) episoded per
session, with recordings from a number of channels.

EEG signals can be manually, per-second filtered for artifacts.  The
PSD analysis is then performed on clean epochs, greatly enhancing the
resulting spectral power profile.  Power course profiles can be
obtained for an arbitrary frequency range.

USAGE NOTES

1. Setting up the experimental design

   Assuming you have all your edf files available and have your
   experimental design laid out, first spend a minute entering the
   session, group, channel and episode details into appropriate fields
   on the 1:Design -> Setup -> Groups, Subjects & Sessions and
   ->Measurements tabs.  In default of your doing so, all these pieces
   of information can be retrieved from the edf sources; however, you
   will still have to add all the groups first.


2. Registering EDF sources

   Proceed to 1:Design -> Setup -> Sources tab and add your edf files,
   one at a time or en gross.  Pay attention to the way these will be
   registered, and do not remove them should you choose to keep them
   outside of the experiment tree.

   When checking in an EDF file, Aghermann will read the edf header
   and extract from it the identification particulars (i.e., subject,
   session, episode, etc).  It then expects the `RecordingID' field to
   be parsable as "<SessionName>, <EpisodeName>"; you will have to
   make sure these tokens appear in this field, in this order, and
   comma-separated.

   o  Also make sure the `Label' field is of the form:
       "<SignalType> <Channel>",
      where <SignalType> is one of "EEG", "ECG", "EOG", "ERG", "EMG",
      "NC", "MEG", "MCG", "EP", "Temp", "Resp", "SaO2", "Light", "Sound",
      "Event", "Freq".  Only signals of EEG type will be selected for the
      PSD analysis (but all signals can nonetheless be viewed.

   o  At present, EDF+ features (in particular, discontinuous signals and
      sub-fields of the `PatientID' field) are not supported.


3. Displaying signals and scoring

   Go to 1:Design -> Overview; the individual recordings will have
   their length listed by episode.  Change the view by selecting a
   different session or channel in the upper-right corner.
   Double-clicking on any one will display the scoring facility.

   In the scoring view, hover the mouse over the "(hint)" label to see
   what actions are available by clicking on the signal, power course
   and hypnogram views; hover over the scoring controls to see the
   corresponding keyboard shortcuts.

   Scoring controls will be inaccessible if you switch to a page
   length different from that you have specified on the Design ->
   Setup -> Measurements tab.

   Click Score at bottom-right to save the scores and artifact
   markings (see below).


4. Filtering out artifacts

   Mark artifacts as neccessary, on a per-second basis, by mouse
   leftclick+drag+release over a length of the displayed page; unmark
   by rightclick+drag+release.  Then rerun the FFT (by clicking on the
   Artifacts button at bottom-right) to have the dirty portions
   excluded from the power course.  These artifact-marked portions of
   the signal will have the signal dampened by a factor of 50.


5. EEG score import/export

   The import filter will read the tokens and attempt to identify the
   score as follows (in a case-insensitive manner):

   W, Wake, 0:			Wake
   N1, N2..4; NREM1..4; 1..4:	NREM Stage 1..4
   R, REM, 5:			REM
   M, MVT, 6:			MVT (Movement Time)
   -, unscored, 9:		Unscored

   All other, unrecognised tokens are skipped and the next token is
   read, but the page currently being identified is not assigned any
   score.  That is, for example, if your file has something other than
   "-", "unscored" or "0" for the Unscored identifier, it will not get
   assigned a score at all, with the next score being applied instead.
   Do some sed work to change the score codes accordingly.


6. Preparing the profiles for simulations

   Once you are done with the preparation of your spectral power
   profiles, proceed to the most interesting part, the Process S
   simulations.

   Edit as necessary the simulation controlling parameters and the
   tunables.  With tunables, those for which the step is set to 0,
   will not be tuned.  Those with the `Required' field cleared, will
   still be tuned, but they will not be required to be stable for a
   model run to complete (the drift distance they do over a stride
   will not be looked at).

   If you have a single sleeping episode per subject/session, the DB2
   amendment does not make sense as it requires some substantial wake
   intervals between sleeping episodes: turn it off in such a case,
   and also set the step value for the rise rate set to 0.  (Strictly
   speaking, for DB2 amendments to be effective, the profile needs to
   be (a) >24h long, and (b) have the timepoint at t=24h in Wake.)

   Likewise, AZ amendment is ineffective for single-episode profiles.


7. Running the simulations

   Then, double-click on a row in the Overview tab.  If all
   constituent episodes have been (at least partially) scored, the
   model run facility will be displayed, showing the profile without
   the simulated SWA nor S at the outset.

   The unscored pages and those scored as MVT will be patched up per
   the settings on the Controlling Parameters tab (i.e., they can be
   assigned a Wake score or the score of the previous page).

   Either click Stride or Run, to do a single stride (400 cycles by
   default), or as many as it will take for all the required
   parameters to stabilise.

   Upon completion, the simulation is saved along with all the
   intermediate steps (but not the log).


8. Reviewing the obtained courses of Process S and SWA

   After a series of strides have completed, you can step back/forward
   through the stride history, to review the optimisation path the
   routine has followed.  At any such checkpoint, you can modify the
   parameter values and resume the model run (to see how nicely and
   unavoidably it converges, for example).

   One especially useful and nifty feature is the live updating of the
   course of Process S in response to your modifying the parameter
   values.

   Click on an episode to display that episode alone.  Take a snapshot
   and save (as a png image) the current view by doing Alt+leftclick.


8. Running simulations in a batch

   Simulations can be run in a batch (drop down the options from the
   Run button on the Simualtions view of the main window).


9. Exporting simulation results

   Finally, export the simulation results into a tab-separated values sheet.


Should you find Aghermann useful (in its scoring capacity only, or
even in the full array of sophistication), write me a note.  Wishlist
features can be considered as a matter of course.

Good luck!
