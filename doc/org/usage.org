* Setting up the experimental design

   Assuming you have all your edf files available and have your
   experimental design laid out, first spend a minute collecting your
   edf sources in an experiment tree following this pattern:

#+begin_example
     ExperimentRoot/Group/Subject/Session/Episode.edf
#+end_example

   Secondly, make sure the recording times stored in the edf files are
   actual and correct as Aghermann will not take guesses if this
   information is missing or incorrect.

   Once your directory tree is set up, start Aghermann, go to
   experiment selector and point it to the newly created experiment
   tree root directory.

   Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop edf files and assign them
   individually to groups/sessions.

   If any edf file needs fixing its header, use edfhed or edfhed-gtk.


* Notes on Signal Type and Label fields in EDF headers

   Make sure the =Label= field is (without quotes) either of
   the form:

#+begin_example
       "<SignalType> <Channel>",
#+end_example
     or just
#+begin_example
       "<Channel>",
#+end_example

   where <SignalType> is one of "EEG", "ECG", "EOG", "ERG", "EMG",
   "NC", "MEG", "MCG", "EP", "Temp", "Resp", "SaO2", "Light", "Sound",
   "Event", "Freq".  Only signals of EEG type will be selected for the
   PSD analysis (other features are applicable to all signals
   regardless).

   If SignalType is omitted, Aghermann will try to match the Channel
   against the list of System 1020 channels for EEG signal types.
   Additionally, channels "Left" and "Right" are recognised as EOG,
   and "Chin", as an EMG signal.

   At present, EDF+ features (in particular, discontinuous signals
   and sub-fields of the `PatientID' field) are not supported.


* Displaying individual episode channel signals and scoring

** Opening an episode in the Scoring Facility

   In the =1. Measurements= view, left-clicking on an episode will
   start the scoring facility for that episode.

   Ctrl-wheel will scale the profile up and down.

   In the Scoring Facility, hover the mouse over the "(hint)" label to
   see what actions are available by clicking on the signal, power
   course overlay and hypnogram views; similarly, tooltips for the
   scoring controls will show corresponding keyboard shortcuts.

   Scoring controls will be inaccessible if you switch to a page
   length different from that specified on the =1. Measurements ->
   Setup -> Profile= tab.

   Click =Score= at bottom-right to save the scores and artifact
   markings (see below).

   Multiple Scoring Facilities can be opened, also for one and the
   same episode.  In the latter case, the one closing last will
   overwrite the .montage file for that episode.

** Signals displayed

   Both /original/ and /filtered/ waveforms can be displayed,
   individually or both at once.  The filtered signal is produced by
   applying the following, in order:

   + Any artifacts.  These artifact-marked portions of the signal will
     have the signal dampened by a factor with edges smoothly merging
     with the adjacent signal regions.

   + Any enabled filters.

** Artifacts

   To mark or clear an artifact manually, select a region with the
   mouse and choose the corresponding menu item.  Holding Shift while
   making selection will do the marking in all channels.

   You can experiment with the automatic *Artifact detection*
   algorithm.  It is based on the difference between
   microcontinuity-dependent and -independent metrics (/SS/ and /SU/)
   determined for a given epoch.

   The various parameters affecting how /SS/ and /SU/ are computed and
   how a decision is reached are as follows:

   | Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                   |
   |-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Granularity                   | Minimal length of a single artifact marking, sec                                                              |
   | /Continuity\/noise metrics/   |                                                                                                               |
   | F_0                           | Centre and -3db-cutoff frequencies, Hz (for these and other parameters, better see paper)                     |
   | F_cutoff                      |                                                                                                               |
   | Bandwidth                     |                                                                                                               |
   | MC Gain                       |                                                                                                               |
   | Back-polate factor            |                                                                                                               |
   | /Artifact selection criteria/ |                                                                                                               |

   | Upper threshold               | Mark period as a hi-freq artifact if /SS/-/SU/[p] > /E/ + /E/ times this value                                |
   | Lower threshold               | Mark period as a lo-freq artifact if /SS/-/SU/[p] < /E/ + /E/ times this value (see pp 1190-1 of cited paper) |


* Refining EEG further with ICA

  You can also try to isolate/distill EEG signals with ICA; for
  explanation of the many options to control ICA process, please
  refer to the authors of the original software (there are handy
  links right next to the Separate button).

  There are two modes of reconstructing channels with ICA:

  + *Map* individual components to channels, possibly preserving others;

  + *Punch* out some ICs and remix.


* EEG score import/export

  The import filter reads the tokens and attempt to identify the
  score as follows (in a case-insensitive manner):

 | Code                      | Score           |
 |---------------------------+-----------------|
 | W, Wake, 0                | Wake            |
 | N1, N2..4; NREM1..4; 1..4 | NREM Stage 1..4 |
 | R, REM, 5                 | REM             |
 | -, unscored, 9            | Unscored        |

  These codes can be configured on =Settings= tab.  All other,
  unrecognised tokens are skipped and the next token is read, but the
  page currently being identified is not assigned any score.  That
  is, for example, if your file has something other than "-",
  "unscored" or "0" for the Unscored identifier, the current page
  will not get assigned a score at all, with the next score being
  applied instead.  Do some sed work to change the score codes
  accordingly.


* Preparing the profiles for simulations

  Once you are done preparing your SWA profiles, proceed
  to the most interesting part, the Process S simulations.

  Edit as necessary the simulatied annealing controlling parameters
  and the tunables.  With tunables, those for which the step is set
  to 0, will not be tuned.

  If you have a single sleeping episode per subject/session, the DB2
  amendment does not make sense as it requires some substantial wake
  intervals between sleeping episodes: turn it off in such a case,
  and also set the step value for the rise rate to 0.  (Strictly
  speaking, for DB2 amendments to be effective, the profile needs to
  be (a) >24h long, and (b) have the timepoint at t=24h in Wake.)

  Likewise, AZ1 amendment is ineffective for single-episode profiles.


* Running the simulations

  Then, double-click on a row in the =2. Simultions= tab.  If all
  constituent episodes have been sufficiently scored, the model run
  facility will be displayed, showing the profile with the simulated
  SWA and S obtained with the default tunable values (which you set
  on the Parameters->Tunables tab).

  Click on an episode to display that episode alone.  You can take a
  snapshot and save (as a png image) the current view by doing
  Alt+leftclick.

  The unscored pages will be patched up per settings on the
  =2. Simulations -> Controlling Parameters= tab (i.e., they can be
  assigned a Wake score or the score of the previous page).

  Click =Run= to find the minimal cost function (sum of squared
  distances between original and simulated SWA) using simulated
  annealing (set/review controlling parameters on
  Parameters->Simulated Annealing tab).

  One especially useful and nifty feature is the live updating of the
  course of Process S in response to your modifying the parameter
  values.  Enabling Live update before starting the annealing will
  show the process of optimisation, but this will be slow.

  You can review the courses of S and either copy-paste the resulting
  tunable values for your stats, or return to the main window and
  click Export to save all obtained simulations to a tsv file.

  You can also run simulations in a batch.
