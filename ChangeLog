	* Don't forget to close edf files (else we hit open files limit
	  after a couple tree rescans).

v. 0.3.5 (2011-10-13)
	* (Hidden) configure option to select main floating point type
	  used in ui (TFloat; mainly to test it works both with double and
	  float).
	* Fix issues with menus in scoring facility.
	* Bring back to life EMG profile.
	* Smooth PSD profile.
	* Groundwork for ICA.

v. 0.3.4 (2011-10-02):
	* General purpose annotations (not those stored in EDF+ files,
	  which are not yet supported).
	* edfhed: make it a simple terminal-only EDF header viewer.
	* edfhed-gtk: provide a .desktop entry; detect whether it is
	  invoked from a terminal or via a menu, and act reasonably
	  accordingly.
	* man: add simple man pages for all executables.
	* debian/control: change priority to Optional.
	* rescan_tree: grey out when any scoring facilities are open to
	  prevent segfaults.
	* delete zero-length ancillary dot files.
	* routine bugfixes.

v. 0.3.3 (2011-09-09):
	* Experiment.tar.bz2: Sample dataset at
	  johnhommer.com/academic/code/aghermann, and a button to automate
	  download on first start.

Major changes going from 0.2.x to 0.3 were:
	* the move to pure C++;
	* move to Gtk3;
	* unified scoring facility signal view on a single drawing area.

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 (2010):
	* use STL (those were really dark ages before this!);
	* thoroughly reengineer the class tree;
	* eventually use cairo for all drawing;
	* mmap large files;
	* use fftw rather than hand-written code which I suspected of
	  out-of-range memory access, but never understood sufficiently to
	  fix anyway;
	* use libresample and some borrowed code from exstrom.com for
	  gentle curves.
