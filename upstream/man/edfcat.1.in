.SH NAME
	edfcat -- EDF file channel mixer/converter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
	edfcat \fIOPERATION\fR \fIOPERANDS\fR
.B
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBedfcat\fR is a tool to manipulate EDF file channels.
Currently, two operations are supported: (1) ascii->edf conversion
(multichannel conversion restricted to channels with identical
samplerate), and (2) channel pruning.
.TP
conv \fBFILE.ascii\fR \fBSAMPLERATE\fR \fBRECORD_SIZE\fR
Convert samples in \fBFILE.ascii\fR into \fBFILE.ascii.edf\fR.
Multiple columns in the source file will be converted as individual
channels.

On success, physical_min/max in each channel will be set to the
absolute min/max of all channel data, widened symmetrically to
whichever boundary is farther from 0 (thus, a range of \-2:3 becomes
\-3:3, as will \-3:2).
.TP
prune \fBFILE.edf\fR \fBN1[,N2,...]\fR
Create a copy of source file (FILE-mod.edf) only keeping channels
\fBN1,N2,...\fR (1-based).
