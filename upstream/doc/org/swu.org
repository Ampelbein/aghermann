* Slow Wave Upswing
  Introduced in version 0.7.5, *SWU* is a poor man's take on measuring
  the local synchronicity of neurons acting together to produce a slow
  wave.

  It is computed as a total sum, over a page, of area under the curve
  of the signal's first derivative where it is positive, discarding
  periods shorter than a certain threshold.

  SWU should to be lower where slow waves have front interrupted by a
  `kink'. It may be extended to also degrade in presence of a slow
  wave terminating in a peak with many (rather than few) local minima.
