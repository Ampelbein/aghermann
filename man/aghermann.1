	Aghermann -- a sleep research experiment manager and Achermann et al (1993) model simulator.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBAghermann\fR is GTK+ program designed to run Process S simulations
on Slow-Wave Activity profiles from EEG recordings as outlined in
Achermann et al (1993).  In this capacity, \fBAghermann\fR produces a
set of sleep homeostat parameters which can be used to describe and
differentiate individual sleepers, such as short vs long sleepers,
early vs late, etc.

Also provided are general-purpose facilities for displaying EEG and
accompanying recordings, such as EOG and EMG, saved in EDF (European
Data Format) files.  These recordings can then be conveniently scored;
scores can be imported/exported in plain ASCII.

If run without arguments, your last session will be restored; an
experiment located in \fIexp_root_dir\fR will be selected otherwise.
