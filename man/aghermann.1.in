.SH NAME
	Aghermann -- a sleep research experiment manager and Achermann et al (1993) model simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
	aghermann [\-n] [\fIEXP_ROOT_DIR\fR]
.B
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBAghermann\fR is a GTK+ program designed to run Process S simulations
on Slow-Wave Activity profiles from EEG recordings as outlined in
Achermann et al (1993).  In this capacity, \fBAghermann\fR produces a
set of sleep homeostat parameters which can be used to describe and
differentiate individual sleepers, such as short vs long sleepers,
early vs late, etc.

Also provided are general-purpose facilities for displaying EEG and
accompanying recordings, such as EOG and EMG, saved in EDF (European
Data Format) files (plain EDF as well as EDF+C are supported).  These
recordings can then be conveniently scored; scores can be
imported/exported in plain ASCII.

If run without arguments, your last session will be restored; an
experiment located in \fIEXP_ROOT_DIR\fR will be selected otherwise.

With option \fB\-n\fR (and an \fIEXP_ROOT_DIR\fR, which is
non-optional in this case), the experiment session in that directory
will be initialised and immediately closed, upon which \fBAghermann\fR
will exit.  No windows will be open and no GTK+ code run; this option
was implemented with the idea of running the core structural part of
\fBAghermann\fR under valgrind.

.SH NOTE ON EDF FILE METADATA
.PP
For Aghermann to be able to manage an EDF file, all relevant fields in
its header must be filled out correctly, as follows:
.IP \(bu
\fBpatient_id\fR uniquely identifies the subject;
.IP \(bu
\fBrecording_id\fR identifies the recording session (out of several
other such sessions, each containing the same series of episodes) and
the individual episode.  These two items must appear in one of the
following combinations:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu
\(dqSession/Episode\(dq
.IP \(bu
\(dqSession : Episode\(dq
.IP \(bu
\(dqEpisode (Session)\(dq
.RE
.IP \(bu
\fBrecording_date\fR and \fBrecording_time\fR must not overlap with
other episodes in the same session and not be too far removed from
each other (more than 7 days).

.SH FILES
.TP
\fI~/.config/aghermann/sessionrc\fR, contains a list of paths to recent experiment trees.
.TP
\fI./.agherman.conf\fR and \fI./.expdesign.conf\fR, saved settings of the experiment located in
this tree.
